## Overview

This simple Processing sketch will allow your Leap Motion device to interact with your Finch Robot. 

## Code Example

* Tilt Hand Down: Robot Moves Forward
* Tilt Hand Up: Robot Moves Back
* Tilt Hand Left: Robot Turns Left
* Tilt Hand Right: Robot Turns Right


## Motivation

For my final CS project, I wanted to combine the ability to use my hand in the physical realm to control a robot, instead of some buttons that one can click, because, no offense, that's pretty boring.

## Steps

* Install Processing
* Install the Leap Motion Processing Library: https://github.com/mrzl/LeapMotionP5
* Install Finch Processing Library: http://www.finchrobot.com/software/processing
* Run my code in a Processing Sketch
* May the Force be with you!
